# Write a program where you create three variables that represent products at a cafe. 
# The products could be beverages such as `coffee,` `cappuccino,` `espresso,` `green tea,` etc. 
# Assign prices to each product.

# Create two more variables called subtotal and totalSale, and complete an “order” for three items of the first product, 
# four items of the second product, and two items of the third product. Add them all together to calculate the subtotal.
#  Create a variable called SALES_TAX and add sales tax to the subtotal to obtain the totalSale amount.

# Write a Python program that calculates the area of a circle based on the radius = 63. 
# To calculate the area of a circle based on the radius, we can use the following formula:
radius = 63
